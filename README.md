# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## 1. Project Description
This project analyzes COVID-19 data from multiple countries to visualize trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations. The analysis focuses on comparing the pandemic's impact across different regions and calculating key metrics like death rates.

## 2. Objectives
- Load and explore COVID-19 dataset
- Clean and prepare data for analysis
- Visualize case trends over time
- Calculate and analyze death rates
- Compare pandemic impacts across countries (Kenya, United States, India)

## 3. Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Matplotlib (for basic visualizations)
- Seaborn (for enhanced visualizations)
- Plotly Express (for interactive visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive development)

## 4. How to Run/View the Project
1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed
2. Install required libraries: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly`
3. Download the dataset 'owid-covid-data.csv'
4. Open and run the analysis.ipynb notebook in Jupyter
5. The notebook will:
   - Import libraries
   - Load and explore the data
   - Clean and filter the data
   - Generate visualizations
   - Calculate death rates

## 5. Insights and Reflections
- The project successfully visualizes COVID-19 trends across selected countries
- Death rate calculations provide a normalized metric for comparing pandemic severity
- Challenges included handling missing data and ensuring accurate calculations
- Future improvements could include:
  - More sophisticated visualizations
  - Additional calculated metrics
  - Machine learning predictions
  - Interactive dashboards for deeper exploration

The analysis demonstrates how data science techniques can help understand pandemic patterns and impacts across different regions.
